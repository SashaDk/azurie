Our team includes one of the most creative photographers, graphic designers, and video editors.</p> 
  <strong class="decor"><span>WHO CREATES AND DELIVERS THE CONTENT?</span></strong>

  <strong class="decor"><span>WHY SHOULD YOU PARTNER WITH US</span></strong>
  <p>We are an independent collective, we are young, positive, action and quality driven, progressive, forward looking, informed about trends and cutting edge ideas.

  <h3>THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL MEDIA PRODUCTION WITH NO PARALLEL IN RUSSIA AND WHOSE TIME HAS COME!</h3>
  <strong class="decor"><span>HOW OUR PARTNERS CAN PARTICIPATE AND PROMOTE THEIR BRANDS</span></strong>
  <p>Azurie operates through a content sponsorships model:</p> 
  <h3>WE DEVELOP, INDEPENDENTLY, BESPOKE REPORTAGE SERIES AND DISTRIBUTE SPONSORED CONTENT THROUGHOUT SOCIAL MEDIA.</h3>
  <p>Our reportages feature top entrepreneurs, thought leaders, and progressive minds. Corporate partners may indicate their preferred topics but content is created independently and is never about the brand itself. Content is then distributed to audiences on Azurie’s online knowledge platform and through social media with a visible mention of our partners’ participation as sponsor of the reportage series.</p> 
  <p>Connect with young, professional, and critical audiences who are hard do reach through traditional media outlets and make a lasting impact on an entrepreneurial society in Russia.</p> 
  <p>Thank you for your attention!</p> 
  <p>We would be happy to answer any of your questions. Please Email us at team@azurie.com</p>
