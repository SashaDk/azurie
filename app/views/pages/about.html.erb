	<strong class="decor"><span>BACKGROUND</span></strong>
	<p>Azurie was launched in Moscow in 2011 by Artem Kiselev, Yuriy Gomozov, and Alexandra Dieterink. Respectively a serial startup entrepreneur, software developer, and venture capital professional. It was prompted by a desire to consolidate important entrepreneurial know-how that is increasingly being shared by thinkers and most innovative participants in business.</p>

  <p>Critical knowledge and guidance for startups is increasingly being sought after in today's competitive and rapidly changing environment. We see valuable insights already being shared online by leading professionals from different sectors. However, these pockets of knowledge are spread around the web with no central hub to read through entrepreneurial know-how by topics, connect to professionals, and stay informed. Azurie is a resolution to bring the smartest minds together and promote those with an entrepreneurial passion.</p>

 <p>The platform is being developed with the support of key contributors from different corners of the globe.</p>
